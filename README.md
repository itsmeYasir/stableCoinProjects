## nUSD stablecoin

A stablecoin backed by ETH is a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to maintain a stable value by pegging it to the value of Ethereum (ETH). The stablecoin is typically collateralized with a reserve of ETH assets, which ensures that the stablecoin's value remains relatively stable and less volatile compared to other cryptocurrencies 

Stablecoins backed by ETH can offer benefits such as faster transactions, lower fees, and increased stability compared to traditional cryptocurrencies. They provide a middle ground between the stability of fiat currencies and the advantages of blockchain technology, enabling users to benefit from the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies while having a stable value tied to the price of ETH.
